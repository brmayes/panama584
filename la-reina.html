        <p>A secluded expanse of white sand is peppered by sun-soaked tourists enjoying the glimmering aqua water of Star Beach. A gentle breeze wicks off of the gentle Caribbean Sea and rustles palm trees guarding the entrance to the mysterious rainforest just 20 feet from the shoreline. Eager feet splash down into clear, salty water from the now-resting boat and then wade through knee-deep water to greet warm, white sand. </p>
        <p>Ana&rsquo;s Restaurant is nestled just steps from the shore in a cove of shady palm trees. Visitors are greeted with an enticing glimpse into the flora of the tropical jungle while resting beneath the overhang of the restaurant. The beach itself is less than a mile long, lined with small, simple wooden structures that house local wares and food. An indigenous Kuna man weaves leaves he gathered from the adjacent rainforest to create baskets and small flowers for souvenir-seeking visitors. Other business owners share their tribal textiles and beaded ornaments to satiate and profit from the commercial demand.</p>
        <p>Tourists line the short shoreline with tropical drinks in hand. Thin plates with freshly fried fish and crisp plantains provide jovial tourists with tastes of the island. From the small window cut in the dark, distressed wood of the Ana&rsquo;s 15x15 restaurant, a deeply tanned, weather-worn, wrinkled hand delivers a plate to an eager tourist. The plate is filled with the carcass of a whole red snapper with only its eyes removed and a deep-yellow mountain of fried plantains, mashed into inch-wide disks that melt into a side of ketchup and mayonnaise. </p>
        <p>Many tourists assume the local fair has just been caught from the sea, but it is often outsourced due to extreme overfishing and a consequent depletion of the fish population. This harsh reality is not something tourists want to consider while enjoying their tropical vacation, but the reality is that the delicate beauty surrounding them is holding on tenuously.</p>
        <p>The tranquil essence of Star Beach is but a semblance of its reality.</p>

        <p>For many years, Ana woke with the sun and prepared her hollowed canoe to carry her and her children into the sea to fish for the day&rsquo;s food. Her life as a fisherwoman was closely tied to the sea. When the fish population began to disappear, Ana found herself in an impossible position of being unable to feed her family.</p>
        <p>Ana was forced to exchange her old, simple way of living off the land for a new life of commerce and business. She opened her own restaurant on Star Beach in an effort to support her family. She purchased a small structure, painted it an inviting shade of emerald with her name inscribed in ivory lettering, purchased new cooking equipment and opened the doors to her restaurant. She worked tirelessly each day to meet the demands of her largely affluent patrons and began to turn a profit. Her departure from the old world to the new was out of necessity, but she has thrived in the new challenge. </p>
        <p>&ldquo;I did what I had to do,&rdquo; she says. Women in Panama have historically stayed at home to take care of children, only more recently beginning to infiltrate the job market. While many have met with success, women still face the challenge overcoming barriers like societal expectation and assumed limitations of women in the business world of Panama.</p>

        <p>Women occupying roles of leadership in Panama is a generally accepted norm. Panama elected its first female president in 1999, and its current vice president is female. In 2012, 79 percent of the female population was enrolled in secondary school, as compared to 73 percent men. While there are more educated women than men in Panama, only 53 percent of the female working-age population is part of the labor force, as compared to 86 percent of men, according to the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/products/wdi" target="_blank">World Bank</a>. </p>
        <p>This stems from Panama&rsquo;s unique dichotomy of old and new. The old way of life in Panama was traditionally patriarchal and assumed men would take the responsibility of breadwinning and women would stay at home to take care of the children. More recently, the need for women to join men in the labor force has increased due to a need for the country to compete with the Global North and modernize. </p>
        <p>Moving forward, educated women are integral to the future of Panama. Women like Ana represent a portion of the population on the threshold of the old and new world. The undercurrent of women being expected to produce less is challenging to overcome, but women like Ana are making small strides to change that perception moving forward.</p>
