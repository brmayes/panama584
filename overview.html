                 Bocas del Drago’s Star Beach is picturesque and serene — white sandy beaches, leafy palm trees,
                 crystal blue water. This is where Ana’s Restaurant is nestled and caters to tourists in floppy sun

            <p>Tourists snap pictures of the glimmering blue waves that kiss the warm, sandy coast. Jaunty palm trees and fallen coconuts punctuate the golden shoreline while brightly colored flora and fauna remind visitors of their exotic location. But the captivating beauty of Bocas del Toro is a seductively peaceful surface for powerful undercurrents of change -- change that is likely to be anything but peaceful.</p>
            <p>Bocas del Toro is a breezy, tropical region on the Caribbean coast of Panama, known most widely for its picturesque beaches and aesthetic topography. Visitors flock to Bocas to snorkel in vibrant coral reefs, kayak through glistening waters, search for friendly sloths in the jungle and encounter monkeys swinging through verdant, leafy trees of the rainforest. Many do not realize the fragility of the beauty that surrounds them. </p>

            <p>Some of the growing issues in Panama are visible just beneath the surface of the shimmering sea. Until the turn of the century, the coral reef in Bocas del Toro was largely characterized by teeming life and a brilliant spectrum of colors. Electric blue octopi would glide across the ocean floor in blissful harmony with their dazzling yellow neighbors, the surgeonfish, who swam in buoyant schools above. Vivid purple corals, crimson sea whips and emerald seagrass served as visual reminders of the abundant life of the sea. But now, much of this brilliant spectrum has faded to muted variations of brown, save a few areas still struggling for life. As a result, many sea creatures have relocated in an effort to survive and thus left the reef barren.</p>
            <p>A short taxi ride out of the main city of Bocas Town, the capital of Bocas del Toro, reveals a concerning phenomenon: large, gray stones encased in twisted wires barricade the seaside. The makeshift-cages are in place to block crashing waves, waves that threaten to wash over roads that struggle to transport tourists to hotels and scenic beaches. The fight for the shoreline is indicative of the struggle among needs for environmental preservation, economic pressures from tourism, rights of the indigenous population and an increasing need for Panama to advance as a developing country. </p>
            <p>Panamanian President, Juan Carlos Varela, recently arrived in Bocas del Toro for a national summit, attended by a cluster of governmental and indigenous leaders, to discuss an increase in the aforementioned concerns. Indigenous leaders insisted on the importance of maintaining the integrity of their native land, while governmental officials brought up the need for modernization in Panama moving forward. Bocas del Toro is especially unique because of its fusion of a lavish ecosystem, incoming tourists from around the globe, considerable population of native citizens and an increasing demand for modernization. These disparaging undercurrents in the region are increasing in force and threaten to create an irreconcilable chasm in Panama. </p>
            <p>These disparate interests have created a tenuous balancing act for locals in Bocas del Toro. </p>

            <p>Local boatman Inocencio &ldquo;Chencho&rdquo; Castillo has spent much of his life on the water. For years, his livelihood was derived from the depths of the sea -- more specifically, from hunting sea turtles.  After Chencho learned the extent of impact his hunting had on the rapidly decreasing turtle population, he transitioned to fighting for the preservation of the sea turtles he once hunted and sold. &ldquo;Scientists say that out of a thousand turtles, just one can survive,&rdquo; said Chencho. &ldquo;I think that number is too little.&rdquo; Chencho moved off of the mainland to an island so he could work full time as a turtle conservationist. </p>

            </figure>

            <p>Chencho is not the only one who made a big move after being inspired by the ecology of Bocas. A trio from Texas uprooted their American lives to move to a remote peninsula near Bocas and start an ecotourism lodge. The lodge provides a way for people to vacation without inadvertently harming the environment. Guests can immerse themselves in a rich world of biodiverse flora and fauna, kayaking through lush mangroves or hiking to bat caves instead of exploiting the environment or disturbing native animals for fleeting amusement. Tourists largely expect the environment to maintain a beautiful landscape while they contribute to its degradation.</p>
            <p>Ana Palacios has been personally impacted by the influx of irreverent tourists. She owns a small business on Star Beach, a popular tourist destination, and makes a living by catering to the whims of vacationers. Ana used to live simply off of the sea, fishing just enough each day to feed her children. But when the fish disappeared from the blue depths, she turned to commercial enterprise to feed her family and opened a restaurant for tourists by the sea. </p>

            <p>The shift from sustenance living to increased industry and commerce has become the reality for many Panamanians, especially the indigenous population -- particularly at the Chiquita plantation. Bananas are central to life, both dietary and occupational, in Bocas del Toro. For this reason, the very real possibility of extinction of the banana, due to a global lethal disease, is harrowing to those in Panama and around the world. Interestingly, the reason that the banana disease is so threatening is that there is no biodiversity in the banana. Levels of biodiversity are directly correlated to the health of the environment. </p>

            </figure>

            <p>There are many demanding undercurrents on the environment in Panama. It must remain beautiful so that it attracts tourist, functional so that it supports traditional ways of life and generous with its resources so that they can be used for national development. With so many competing undercurrents, the calm seen on the surface of Bocas del Toro is really a guise for the brewing storm.</p>
