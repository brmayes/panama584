        <h1>The undercurrents of Bocas</h1>
        <p class="article_credits"><strong>Written by:</strong> Anne Marie Haggerty</p>
        <p>
          Bocas del Toro is a region off the western Caribbean coast of Panama known for its incredible beauty. Tourists snap pictures of crystal blue water and picturesque palm trees, not realizing the fragility of the beauty around them. Visitors snorkel in vibrant coral reefs, kayak through glistening waters and watch friendly sloths and playful monkeys swing through tall, tropical trees in the rainforest.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the beauty of Bocas that captivates so many is pulled by undercurrents of change.

          A short taxi ride outside of the main city of Bocas reveals a troubling phenomenon along the coastline. Large, gray stones encased in twisted wires barricade the seaside of the roadway to block crashing waves that threaten to wash over roads that transport tourists to hotels and scenic beaches. The continued fight for the shoreline is indicative of the struggle between the environment and the need for tourism on the island.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a growing tension in Panama between environmental preservation, the economic pressures of tourism, rights of the indigenous population and a growing desire for Panama to advance as a modern country. Bocas del Toro is a unique place because it combines all of these elements: a rich environment, tourists from every corner of the earth, the presence of native peoples and the chance to modernize.
        </p>
        <p>
          The newly-elected president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, recently met with indigenous leaders from across the country in Bocas del Toro to discuss many of the issues facing the people including balancing environmental sustainability with economic stability and growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indigenous waterman Inocencio “Chencho” Castillo, fights a similar battle to preserve the sea turtles he once hunted, killed and sold. Today he fights difficult tides and sleeps on an island with only the turtles he strives to protect from the changing environment and competing human influences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of these changes are evident just below the surface of the sea. The coral reef in Bocas was once characterized by a brilliant spectrum of colors. These are now fading to muted variations of brown. The reef is slowly dying as a result of overfishing from the local population, ocean temperature rise and increased pollution.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Panamanian economy relies heavily on their service industry, of which tourism is integral. Environmental degradation veils the beauty of the land and consequently an appeal for tourists to visit the country causing a problem for the Panamanian economy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The effect that tourists, either unknowingly or apathetically, have on the environment can be deleterious in the long term if not monitored. The severe impact of environmental degradation and threats attached to decreased biodiversity are poignantly seen in the case of the banana.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vice President Isabel Saint Malo and Mirei Heras, Minister of the Environment, held a conference in Bocas del Toro announcing plans and urging sustainable and ecologically-friendly tourism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Places such as Tranquilo Bay, a region on the coast of Bastimentos Island, have spent years cultivating a haven for travellers to immerse themselves in a rich world of biodiverse plants and animals in an environmentally responsible way. Guests enjoy the thrills of seeing recently-discovered species of butterflies and kayaking through mangroves rather than disturbing animals in their natural habitat for fleeting human amusement.
        </p>
        <p>
          The severe impact of environmental degradation and threats attached to decreased biodiversity are poignantly seen in the case of the banana.
        </p>
        <p>
          The banana is central to life in mainland Bocas. To the dismay of locals, the fruit faces the threat of worldwide extinction due to a lack of diversity in the banana and a fungus that can exploit the banana’s weaknesses. An event that will not only impact consumers across the globe but will directly impact the Panamanian economy and the local people of Bocas.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rich, distinct culture of the indigenous people of Panama is deeply woven into the fabric of the nation but faces a difficult struggle with the growing shift toward modernization. The indigenous people of Panama were the first inhabitants of the land centuries ago and a simple sustenance-based economic system have developed from living off the land. However, many indigenous people have been forced to trade their thatched roof homes and hollowed out canoes in exchange for commercial life in the city
        </p>
        <p>
          As waves of progress roll into Bocas del Toro, the undercurrents of economic growth, ecological conservation and indigenous ways of life confluence to show the future, not only for this island paradise, but for the whole of Panama as well.
