        <h1>The undercurrents of Bocas</h1>
        <p class="article_credits"><strong>Written by:</strong> Anne Marie Haggerty</p>
        <p>
          Bocas del Toro is a region off the western Caribbean coast of Panama known for its incredible beauty. Tourists snap pictures of crystal blue water and picturesque palm trees, not realizing the fragility of the beauty around them. Visitors snorkel in vibrant coral reefs, kayak through glistening waters and watch friendly sloths and playful monkeys swing through tall, tropical trees in the rainforest.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the beauty of Bocas that captivates so many is pulled by undercurrents of change.

        <p>Tourists snap pictures of glimmering blue waves as they wash up to kiss the warm, sandy coast. Jaunty palm trees and fallen coconuts punctuate the golden shoreline while brightly-colored flora and fauna, reminding visitors of their exotic location. But the captivating beauty of Bocas del Toro is conflicted by a growing undercurrent.</p>
        <p>Bocas del Toro is a breezy, tropical region on the Caribbean coast of Panama, known most widely for its picturesque beaches and aesthetic topography. Visitors flock to Bocas to snorkel in vibrant coral reefs, kayak through glistening waters, search for friendly sloths in the jungle and encounter monkeys swinging through verdant, tropical trees in the rainforest. Many do not realize the fragility of the beauty that surrounds them. </p>
        <p>A short taxi ride out of the main city of Bocas Town, the capital of Bocas del Toro, reveals a concerning phenomenon: large, gray stones encased in twisted wires barricade the seaside. The makeshift-cages are in place to block crashing waves which threaten to wash over meager roads that transport tourists to hotels and scenic beaches. The fight for the shoreline is indicative of the struggle among needs for environment preservation, economic pressures from tourism, the rights of the indigenous population and an increasing need for Panama to advance as a developing country. </p>
        <p>Panamanian President, Juan Carlos Varela, recently arrived in Bocas del Toro for a national summit, attended by a cluster of governmental and indigenous leaders, to discuss such growing concerns in Panama. Maintaining the integrity of indigenous lands while recognizing the need for modernization moving forward was addressed -- and contended. </p>
        <p>Bocas del Toro is a unique place because a lavish ecosystem, incoming tourists from around the globe, considerable population of native citizens and the increasing demand for modernization all fuse together. Various undercurrents in the region are increasing in force and threaten to create an irreconcilable chasm in Panama.</p>

        <p>Many of the tensions in Panama are visible just beneath the surface of the shimmering sea. The coral reef in Bocas del Toro was once characterized by teeming life and a brilliant spectrum of colors. Electric blue octopi would glide across the ocean floor in blissful harmony with their dazzling yellow neighbors, the surgeonfish, as they swam in buoyant schools above them. Vivid purple corals, crimson sea whips and emerald seagrass served as visual reminders of the vivacious life of the sea.</p>
        <p>Much of the vibrant spectrum has faded to muted variations of brown, save a few areas still struggling for life. As a result, many fish and sea creatures have relocated in an effort to survive and thus left the reef barren. Ironically, the reef is slowly dying in part because of overfishing by the local population. </p>
        <p>Local boatman Inocencio &ldquo;Chencho&rdquo; Castillo has spent much of his life on the water. He used to make a living off of fishing in the sea, but most of his income was made selling the coveted indigenous delicacy of sea turtle eggs. After Chencho learned the extent of impact his hunting had on the rapidly decreasing turtle population, he transitioned to fighting for the preservation of the sea turtles he once hunted and sold. He moved off of the mainland to an island so that he could sleep with and protect the turtles from changing environmental conditions and adverse human influences.</p>
        <p>Environmental degradation is slowly diminishing the characteristic beauty of Bocas&rsquo; natural land. This has decreased the appeal for tourists to visit the country, which is problematic for the service-based Panamanian economy, of which tourism is integral. Vice President Isabel Saint Malo and Minister of the Environment Mirei Endara de Heras held a conference in Bocas del Toro to urge local business owners to pursue sustainable tourism operations in an effort to preserve the industry and not exploit the environment.</p>
        <p>Operations like Tranquilo Bay, an eco-lodge on the southern coast of Bastimentos Island, have spent years cultivating a haven for travelers to vacation in an environmentally responsible way. Guests immerse themselves in a rich world of biodiverse plants and animals, enjoying the thrills of seeing recently discovered species of butterflies or kayaking through lush mangroves rather than exploiting the environment and disturbing native animals for fleeting amusement.</p>
        <p>Respecting the environment and working to protect biodiversity is paramount. The harrowing repercussions of negligence to that regard are blatantly observed in the case of the banana.</p>
        <p>Bananas are central to life, both dietary and occupational, in Bocas del Toro. To the dismay of locals, the fruit faces the threat of worldwide extinction due to a lethal fungus. Because there is no genetic biodiversity in the banana, it is not able to fight against the disease that is targeted specifically to the strain. The banana will be wiped out if another breed is not created. </p>
        <p>The potential extinction of the banana will impact consumers around the globe as well as the Panamanian economy and, more directly, the livelihood of the people of Bocas del Toro.</p>
        <p>Many workers and consumers of the banana are from the indigenous population. The indigenous people of Panama are woven deeply into the fabric of the nation. They were the first inhabitants of the land centuries ago and have since operated through a simple sustenance-based economic system. However, due to an increase in industry, many have been forced to trade their thatched roof homes and hollowed-out canoes for commercial life. </p>
        <p>Furthermore, the indigenous population owns land, la comarca, that is reserved for their use and can not be developed. However, governmental officials are under pressure to modernize the country and thus feel compelled to exploit the resources to do so, as in the case of wanting to blast for iron in Chiriqui. Maintaining the integrity of indigenous land while recognizing the need for modernization moving forward was addressed at the President&rsquo;s meeting with indigenous leaders. The tension between environmental preservation, indigenous rights and the need for modernization is an issue on the world stage, but seen clearly in the growing Panamanian chasm.</p>
        <p>As waves of progress roll into Bocas del Toro, the undercurrents of economic growth, ecological conservation and indigenous ways of life merge to show the future, not only for this island paradise, but for the whole of Panama.</p>

        <p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that great strides have been made in the Panama banana industry.</p>
        <p>Cooperation with environmental agencies, coupled with the desire to acknowledge and empower workers, has impacted Bocas del Toro.</p>
        <p>Cooperatives are owned and run by Panamanian workers themselves, employers have the right to unionize, and companies have gone to considerable lengths to improve the environment.</p>
        <p>Jasch said that companies like Chiquita have started reforesting areas surrounding the fincas.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;This is not just planting trees for trees,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo; No &mdash; this is creating biological corridors.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>But banana industries everywhere face an inevitable threat: tropical race 4, the fourth strain, of the Panama Disease.</p>
        <p>This soil-based fungal disease, which attacks the banana plant and lives in the soil for decades on end, could bring the permanent disappearance of commercial bananas in Panama.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;This disease called tropical race 4 is certainly capable of destroying banana farms, and is capable of creating a very serious situation for companies, for their employees and for consumers if it comes to have a big impact on worldwide
          banana production,&rdquo; Jasch said.</p>
        <p>But Jasch said the threat is not imminent. Rather, it is a manageable risk.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;However, it has to be said that there's no foolproof system to prevent this from spreading to Latin America,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But the probability, at the moment, is relatively low.&rdquo; </p>
        <p>Ortiz, the general manager of Coobana, agreed.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The important thing is to continue to take precaution and to avoid the arrival of this disease in Latin America,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Because if the disease comes here, we'll have a very big concern. &ldquo;Because if there&rsquo;s
          a man working per hectare, the economic capacity depends heavily on bananas. And any imbalance in the production &mdash; it&rsquo;s going to attack first our labour, and that is from the social-&shy;economic point of view.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>That means that men like Baker and Palacio &mdash; men who haven&rsquo;t escaped the strongholds of poverty but have made successful strides in alleviating some banana production vices &mdash; could be threatened by economic and social instability
          that results from Tropical Race 4&rsquo;s potential to eradicate commercial bananas.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;This business feeds us,&rdquo; Baker said. &ldquo;If there weren&rsquo;t bananas we could sow more products like rice and &ntilde;amp&iacute;, and maybe the money would decrease, but we have to eat.&rdquo;</p>

      <div class="intro container-text">
        <p>Under the guise of globalization, banana republics wreaked havoc on Latin American countries.</p>
        <p>When companies, like the United Fruit Company, came into these humid and almost uninhabited areas of Latin America, where conditions were ripe for growing bananas, they were able to do so without paying much regard to the sovereignty of the people.
          The company is known for usurping and bribin presidents, exploiting workers for cheap labor, and deforesting acres and acres of untouched lands. </p>
        <p>The Snyder Brothers Banana Company came to Bocas del Toro in 1890. When it was completely taken over by United Fruit Company, banana fincas began popping up across the peninsula. </p>
        <p>While the company is responsible for modernizing the province by building schools, hospitals, roads and bridges, it neglected the rights of workers and landowners, working conditions and the environment..</p>
        <p>Today, that&rsquo;s no longer the case.Companies are making great strides to improve relations with their employees. </p>
        <p>George Jasch, president of the Biodiversity Partnership Mesoamerica and former director of sustainability at Chiquita, said companies like Chiquita, the successor of United Fruit Company, and smaller cooperatives have made considerable changes
          since the era of banana republics. Companies now acknowledge workers&rsquo; rights, especially those of women and indigenous workers, and work to restore biodiversity to the nearby Panamanian rainforests.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There are several big issues of course, globally,&rdquo; Jasch said. &ldquo;But one of the most important areas, actually, right after climate change is the current loss of biodiversity, which is progressing globally and affecting every
          region.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>In 1992, Chiquita paired with the Rainforest Alliance. A huge development, Jasch said, because the company publicly committed to certifying their farms with the Rainforest Alliance. This certification means that farms are independently examined
          annually to ensure that they are operating in compliance with environmental, social and human rights and the law.</p>
        <p>Following years riddled with hardship, when banana plantations in Panama were ravaged by the uncontrollable and incurable fungal disease known as &ldquo;Panama Disease&rdquo; and the almost complete withdrawal of Chiquita from Bocas del Toro and
          the city&rsquo;s economic collapse, cooperatives helped Bocas del Toro find a way to survive the banana crisis. It is the only banana-producing region remaining in Panama.</p>
        <p>Cooperativa Bananera del Atlantico R.L, or Coobana, was created by former Chiquita employees. </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Coobana is nothing more than a national cooperative where the partners are the owners,&rdquo; said the cooperative's general manager, Ernesto Ortiz. &ldquo;That way you can see the social part, since men are the first resource in banana
          production. Second is the environment, concerned with costs and quality.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Coobana owns nearly 600 hectares, the equivalent of more than 1400 acres, of land designated for banana growing and directly employs about 500 workers. &nbsp;The cooperative is mostly made up of indigenous workers, almost 80 percent, and is growing
          in the number of women employees.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, the employees, of course, are crucial and necessary for banana production,&rdquo; Jasch said. Because bananas are dependent on humans to be planted, grown and harvested, employees are needed to look after the bananas at every step
          of the production process. </p>
        <p>And employees have realized this. Almost half of Coobana&rsquo;s employees are union members. Ignacio Palacio, a harvester, is an active member of the local union and helped advocate for fair wages. </p>
        <p>&ldquo;The workplace is, of course, the place where employees spend most of their waking hours,&rdquo; Jasch said. &ldquo;What happens there has very substantial influence &mdash; not just economic, but also the way of thinking, the level of education,
          and so on.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Palacio is proof of the workplace&rsquo;s trickle-down influence. He meets weekly with a group of high school students as their mentor.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I work with bananas,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I work hard so that they can have opportunities.&rdquo;</p>
