            <figcaption>Demetrio Baker has been harvesting bananas at Finca 80 for 26 years. Unlike other fruit, bananas can be harvested every day of the year and the steady income from his work allows Demetrio to feed and support his wife and children, sending several of them to school.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Acres and acres deep into dense thickets of banana plants, nothing can be heard but the methodical swing of machetes.</p>
          <p>Aside from thousands of banana plants and a few hundred workers, nothing can be seen.</p>
          <p>Demetrio Baker is one of those workers.</p>
          <p>From the break of day until evening, Baker harvests this precious fruit.</p>
          <p>He works meticulously. In one swift motion, he pokes a long metal stake between the banana&rsquo;s stalk and the earth, holding the plant up, before he sends the machete&rsquo;s blade hissing through the air. It slices the plant just enough to make it fold. When the plant gives way, an abundant bunch of green bananas bends toward Baker. After separating the bunches, he severs the fruit from the plant and sends it away to be processed. </p>
          <p>This is what he does day in and day out, year round.</p>
          <p>From here, the banana journeys from the banana finca, where it is grown, to be harvested and packaged to stores and markets across Europe &mdash; a world Baker has never known. A place he will probably never see. </p>

            <figcaption>Drainage ditches crisscross banana farms, carrying excess water out of the fields. These ditches can also carry aerially-applied fungicides and sediment runoff into nearby water systems, eventually reaching the ocean and damaging marine ecosystems. Perforated plastic bags infused with low levels of pesticides (seen in blue) are placed over bananas as the fruit starts to develop, protecting the fruit from any natural or insect damage and creating a small microclimate so that the fruit can be harvested sooner.</figcaption>

          <p>Panama isn&rsquo;t known for its banana production, though the history of banana production in this country is among the likes of many other Latin American countries. A history that includes exploitation.</p>
          <p>These countries were known as banana republics. They were countries whose economies were painfully dependent on banana exports, and whose societies were perched on the diverging social branches of impoverished employees, wealthy bureaucrats and business owners.</p>
          <p>Though Panama is no longer considered a banana republic, the country is still haunted by this past and the Bocas del Toro province still relies heavily on the banana industry.</p>
          <p>For workers like Baker, it is their only source of income. Bananas are the means through which they both live and survive. It is how Baker was able to afford a new home and send his seven children to school.</p>

            A History of Resilience
          </p>
          <p>Under the guise of globalization, banana republics wreaked havoc on Latin American countries.</p>
          <p>When companies, like the United Fruit Company, came into these humid and almost uninhabited areas of Latin America, where conditions were ripe for growing bananas, they were able to do so without paying much regard to the sovereignty of the people. The company is known for usurping and bribing presidents, exploiting workers for cheap labor, and deforesting acres and acres of untouched lands. </p>
          <p>The Snyder Brothers Banana Company, an American-owned banana company, came to Bocas del Toro in 1890. The company brought with it development that would change the face of the region. A canal, which connected the Changuinola river to the Caribbean Sea, was the critical vein through which all goods, laborers and produce needed in the banana industry flowed. </p>
          <p>The company was soon taken over by United Fruit Company. Shortly thereafter, banana fincas were popping up across the peninsula. </p>
          <p>While the company is responsible for modernizing the province by building schools, hospitals, roads and bridges, it often neglected the rights of workers and landowners, working conditions and the environment.</p>
          <p>Today, that&rsquo;s no longer the case. Companies are making great strides to improve relations with their employees. </p>
          <p>George Jasch, president of the Biodiversity Partnership Mesoamerica and former director of sustainability at Chiquita, said companies like Chiquita, the successor of United Fruit Company, and smaller cooperatives have made considerable changes since the era of banana republics. Companies now acknowledge workers&rsquo; rights, especially those of women and indigenous workers, and work to restore biodiversity to the nearby Panamanian rainforests.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;There are several big issues, of course, globally,&rdquo; Jasch said. &ldquo;But one of the most important areas, actually, right after climate change is the current loss of biodiversity, which is progressing globally and affecting every region.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>In 1992, Chiquita paired with the Rainforest Alliance. A huge development, Jasch said, because the company publicly committed to certifying their farms with the Rainforest Alliance. This certification means that farms are independently examined annually to ensure that they are operating in compliance with environmental, social and human rights standards and the law.</p>
          <p>Following years riddled with hardship, when banana plantations in Panama were ravaged by the uncontrollable and incurable fungal disease known as &ldquo;Panama Disease&rdquo; and the almost complete withdrawal of Chiquita from Bocas del Toro and the city&rsquo;s economic collapse, cooperatives helped Bocas del Toro find a way to survive the banana crisis. It is the only banana-producing region remaining in Panama.</p>
          <p>Cooperativa Bananera del Atlantico R.L, or Coobana, was created by former Chiquita employees. </p>

          <figure class="story-image">
            <img alt="Workers at the processing plant" src="media/stories/bananas/20160314_banana_mrl_134.jpg" />
            <figcaption>Workers at the processing plant at Finca 80 stack boxes of free trade, green bananas onto a cart so they can be transported by truck to nearby ports and shipped to Europe.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>&ldquo;Coobana is nothing more than a national cooperative where the partners are the owners,&rdquo; said the cooperative's general manager, Ernesto Ortiz. &ldquo;That way you can see the social part, since men are the first resource in banana production. Second is the environment, concerned with costs and quality.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Coobana owns nearly 600 hectares, the equivalent of more than 1400 acres, of land designated for banana growing and directly employs about 500 workers. The cooperative is mostly made up of indigenous workers, almost 80 percent, and is growing in the number of women employees.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;&#65279;Well, the employees, of course, are crucial and necessary for banana production,&rdquo; Jasch said. Because bananas are dependent on humans to be planted, grown and harvested, employees are needed to look after the bananas at every step of the production process. </p>
          <p>And employees have realized this. Almost half of Coobana&rsquo;s employees are union members. Ignacio Palacio, a harvester, is an active member of the local union and helped advocate for fair wages. </p>
          <p>&ldquo;The workplace is, of course, the place where employees spend most of their waking hours,&rdquo; Jasch said. &ldquo;What happens there has very substantial influence &mdash; not just economic, but also the way of thinking, the level of education, and so on.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Palacio is proof of the workplace&rsquo;s trickle-down influence. He meets weekly with a group of high school students as their mentor.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;I work with bananas,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I work hard so that they can have opportunities.&rdquo;</p>

            The Foreseeable Threat
          </p>

          <p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that great strides have been made in the Panama banana industry.</p>
          <p>Cooperation with environmental agencies, coupled with the desire to acknowledge and empower workers, has impacted Bocas del Toro.</p>
          <p>Cooperatives are owned and run by Panamanian workers themselves, employers have the right to unionize, and companies have gone to considerable lengths to improve the environment.</p>
          <p>Jasch said that companies like Chiquita have started reforesting areas surrounding the fincas.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;This is not just planting trees for trees,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo; No &mdash; this is creating biological corridors.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>But banana industries everywhere face an inevitable threat: Tropical Race 4, the fourth strain, of the Panama Disease.</p>
          <p>This soil-based fungal disease, which attacks the banana plant and lives in the soil for decades on end, could bring the permanent disappearance of commercial bananas in Panama.</p
          <p>&ldquo;This disease called Tropical Race 4 is certainly capable of destroying banana farms, and is capable of creating a very serious situation for companies, for their employees and for consumers if it comes to have a big impact on worldwide banana production,&rdquo; Jasch said.</p>
          <p>But Jasch said the threat is not imminent. Rather, it is a manageable risk.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;However, it has to be said that there's no foolproof system to prevent this from spreading to Latin America,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But the probability, at the moment, is relatively low.&rdquo; </p>
          <p>Ortiz, the general manager of Coobana, agreed.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;The important thing is to continue to take precaution and to avoid the arrival of this disease in Latin America,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Because if the disease comes here, we'll have a very big concern. </p>

          <figure class="story-image">
            <img alt="Demetrio Baker" src="media/stories/bananas/20160314_banana_cat_051.jpg" />
            <figcaption>Demetrio Baker relies on the productivity of banana farms for his income. If a new strain of fungus, like Tropical Race 4, causes a dramatic reduction in production, the local economy will be devastated.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>&ldquo;Because if there&rsquo;s a man working per hectare, the economic capacity depends heavily on bananas. And any imbalance in the production &mdash; it&rsquo;s going to attack, first, our labour and that is from the social-&shy;economic point of view.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>That means that men like Baker and Palacio &mdash; men who haven&rsquo;t escaped the strongholds of poverty but have made successful strides in alleviating some vices of banana production &mdash; could be threatened by economic and social instability that results from Tropical Race 4&rsquo;s potential to eradicate commercial bananas.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;This business feeds us,&rdquo; Baker said. &ldquo;If there weren&rsquo;t bananas we could sow more products like rice and &ntilde;amp&iacute;, and maybe the money would decrease, but we have to eat.&rdquo;</p>
