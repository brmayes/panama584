						<h2>What's in an Orchestra?</h2>
						<p>

							Have you ever wondered what some of those funny-looking instruments in the orchestra are, or what they sound like? Check
							out the following slideshow to find out!

						<h2>Double Bass</h2>   <!--Daniel Barbiero-->
						<p>
							The double bass is the biggest and lowest-sounding instrument in the string section. Sometimes the double bass gets a solo, but it's
							more common for it to stay in the background.

						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Double bass players spend a lot of time plucking their instrument rather than using their bow. This is called pizzicato.
					</p>
					<br>

						Mouse over the double bass to hear its sound!

						<h2>French Horn</h2>
						<p>
							The French horn is related to the hunting horns of old. In the orchestra, it usually plays long sustained notes.
							If unwound, it would be about 17 feet long!
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							People who play the french horn have to use one of their hands to change the sound inside the large opening at the end, called a bell.

						<h2>Saxophone</h2>
						<p>
						 The saxophone is most well-known in jazz music, but it can be used in orchestras too! It has a really harsh sound
						 which makes it easy to distinguish from the rest of the orchestra.
					 </p>
					 <br>
					 <p>
						 There are six different types of saxophone, but they are all played using a mouthpiece called a reed.

						<h2>Trumpet</h2>
						<p>
						The trumpet has a very loud and brassy sound, so it is often used to belt out an important melody. It looks kind of like
						a paperclip, but it would actually be about 6 1/2 feet long unwound!

						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							The trumpet's valves control the flow of air inside the instrument, creating all the sounds a trumpet can make.

						<h2>Harp</h2>
						<p>
						The harp isn't very loud,
							but it can make some very beautiful sounds. It wasn't really used in orchestras until the 1800s.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>The harps used in orchestras have 47 different strings. They also have seven pedals that can change
							the sound of those strings. All of that makes tuning the harp a very extensive process!
