        <p>A dark wooden dock peeks out from a trove of neatly carved mangroves, invites guests into the secluded splendor of Tranquilo Bay, an eco-adventure lodge in Bocas del Toro. Travelers are entertained by flying fish and dolphin sightings as they cruise across deep, blue Caribbean waters on a small boat, sailing from the mainland of Bocas del Toro to a peninsula jutting out into the sea called Bastimentos. </p>
        <p>A green tunnel, sculpted from interlacing, above-ground roots teeming tropical foliage, welcomes explorers to stroll through it as they walk from the dock to the entrance of the lofted lodge. A neat concrete path winds through the flora with remarkable harmony and leads visitors to the rich, warm wood of the immaculate main lodge. High ceilings dotted with creamy palm-blade fans circulate the sultry air. Once settled in one of their stucco-style cabanas, guests can choose to meet fish through a snorkeling mask in the coral reef, kayak through vibrant shrubs which spring from the tidal shores, fish in the aquamarine sea, explore bat caves, search for new species of butterflies in the 200-acre tropical jungle or meet lazy sloths hanging in the trees. </p>
        <p>But before the naturalistic haven of Tranquilo Bay was constructed, it was a large expanse of wild, untamed land. A team of three from corporate America, with no experience in construction or starting their business, traded their comfortable lives in the United States for a pair of machetes and a new home in the depths of the jungle.</p>

        <p>Jim and Renee Kimball are a spunky Texan couple. They met in college and shared a dream of owning their own business in the tropics. They shared this dream to a close college friend, Jay Viola, who agreed to join them. &ldquo;When I met Jim, we agreed we never wanted to go the typical path,&rdquo; Renee Kimball said. </p>
        <p>They hoped to create a tropical haven that would give patrons a place to experience natural tropical beauty in an environmentally responsible way. When the team found the exuberant, contiguous 200-acre property in Bastimentos in 1999, they knew it was where they would create Tranquilo Bay. The Texans pledged to develop and protect the land by creating a destination for adventurous eco-tourists to come and enjoy the captivating, tropical beauty of Panama while still respecting the environment. </p>
        <p>For this dream to become a reality, Renee Kimball worked 15-hour days as a technology attorney based in Texas &nbsp;to send funds to her husband, Jim, and Jay Viola as the two men spent their days working in the depths of the Panamanian jungle with machetes in hand. Neither of the two had formal training in construction and couldn&rsquo;t find a reliable contractor in the remote area, so they searched the internet for plans on how to construct electric, plumbing and HVAC systems. </p>
        <p>Jim Kimball and Jay Viola spent five years swinging their machetes in the jungle to tame the wild land for symbiotic use. Because they retained &nbsp;great respect for the environment throughout the project, the land is now able to thrive while also housing its human counterparts.</p>

        <p>The Bastimentos ecolodge lures travelers who crave a reprieve from the demands of daily life and want to enjoy the unadulterated beauty of nature. For this reason, 75 percent of the Panamanian economy comes from the service industry, of which tourism is integral. Recently, tourism has been the subject of much debate on the political front. Minister of the Environmental Authority of Panama Mirei Endara de Heras came to Bocas del Toro to hold a meeting that Renee Kimball, among other business owners in the area, was invited to attend. Heras spoke about the need for sustainable methods of tourism to keep the industry alive. The concern is that unsustainable, exploitative tourism will adversely impact the environment to an unsalvageable point.</p>
        <p>The United Nations Division on Development <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/natlinfo/indicators/guidelines.pdf" target="_blank">addressed the issue</a> in the third edition of its Indicators and Sustainable Development guidelines. According to the guidelines, &ldquo;The use of natural resources by local residents takes a toll on the land, and development is often bad for the environment.&rdquo; </p>
        <p>While development and disruption of the land can have deleterious effects, places like Tranquilo Bay are working to make an impact by providing sustainable options like hiking, surfing, snorkeling or birding for eco tourists to enjoy. </p>
        <p>The mission of sustainable development, as defined by the United Nations, is, &ldquo;Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.&rdquo; For Jim and Renee Kimball, this mission is personal. Their long-term goal is to cultivate Tranquilo Bay in a such a way so if their children, Tres and Boti, and Jay&rsquo;s son Scott, have the option to take over their thriving, healthy business one day. </p>
        <p>The elusive &ldquo;future generation&rdquo; referred to en masse is made very personal when applied to individual, precious children who are growing up with a rightful expectation that the verdant jungles they love will continue to mature along with them. The Mission of Tranquilo Bay is to care for the land in such a way that their children will one day be able to do the same.</p>
