          <p>Inocencio &ldquo;Chencho&rdquo; Castillo is a petite, yet sturdy man. His gait is slightly uneven, each step measured with care. He has an unassuming face
            that widens every so often when a smile forces his lips apart to reveal a toothless grin.</p>
          <p>Sometimes he smiles at the litter of kittens that runs in and around his house, sometimes at his neighbors as they pass.</p>
          <p>He spends most of his time sitting on his porch, as do most people in Isla Colon, his <em>barrio</em> in Bocas del Toro, Panama. </p>
          <p>&ldquo;Mostly, I just stay quiet and drink coffee,&rdquo; he chuckles. </p>
          <p>When he&rsquo;s not tending to the neighborhood cats, watching his neighbors or keeping to himself, he is working to protect an endangered species of turtles.</p>
          <p>After a few moments, he gets up from his chair and pushes past the orange cotton curtain that leads to his room. When he returns, he&rsquo;s cradling a small glass jar in his leathered hands &mdash; hands that spent years pulling hundreds of
            fish from the sea.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen this before?&rdquo; Chencho asks, though he already knows the answer.</p>
          <p>The jar held a dead two-headed, hawksbill sea turtle. </p>
          <p>&ldquo;It only lived for 24 hours,&rdquo; he said.</p>
          <p>He had done what he could to save the unique turtle &mdash; he took it home, put in a pool of water and even prepared lobster for the turtle to eat. Despite his efforts, the turtle died.</p>
          <p>This wasn&rsquo;t the first hawksbill sea turtle to die in Chencho&rsquo;s hands, but this turtle&rsquo;s death carried a different weight.</p>

            A population in peril

          <p>Hawksbill sea turtles are a reflection of the vibrant coral reefs they inhabit.</p>
          <p>Their oval-shaped shells range in color from deep to golden brown, painted with streaks of red, orange and black that mirror the coral reef&rsquo;s colors. While the turtles nest in the reefs, they can migrate more than 1,000 miles to find food.</p>
          <p>The hawksbill&rsquo;s ability to crush, crunch and crawl into sponges &mdash; its primary source of food &mdash; gives the turtle its name.</p>
          <p>While the turtle&rsquo;s mouth resembles the rounded, sharp beak of a hawk, one can&rsquo;t help but notice the turtle&rsquo;s uncanny resemblance to Chencho.</p>
          <p>Perhaps it's the turtle&rsquo;s own toothless grin or its leathered back. Maybe it&rsquo;s the wavering gait it has as it crawls across the shore, leaving uneven patterns in the sand. </p>
          <p>It could be that both the hawksbill and men like Chencho are disappearing. Hawksbills are on the brink of extinction and local conservationists, like Chencho who care about the turtles, are few and far between.</p>
          <p>There has been a devastating decline in population of hawksbill turtles. In the last century alone, over 80 percent of these turtles have disappeared.</p>
          <p>The Caribbean is home to almost 30 percent of the world&rsquo;s hawksbill population. The corals in Panama used to be one of the most important nesting destinations in the world for these turtles. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>But human survival &mdash; doing whatever it takes to avoid poverty &mdash; has had damning effects on the turtles. </p>
          <p>&ldquo;In those days, Japan bought turtle shells from us,&rdquo; Chencho recalls. &ldquo;And you would sleep on the beach just to get the tortoiseshell because it was worth $50 per pound. You just can&rsquo;t imagine how many people were waiting
            on the beach with harpoons, but without sleep.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>According to a 2008 report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, Japan imported more than 1.3 million hawksbill shells, also known as tortoiseshells or <em>bekko</em> in Japanese markets, between the 1950s and 1990s. &nbsp;During
            this same time, Panama exported more than 150,000 hawksbills to Japan. </p>
          <p>A study by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the world's main authority on the conservation status of species and promoters of their conservation, revealed that Panama was the most important source of hawksbills
            to Japan&rsquo;s bekko industry during this time. </p>
          <p>&ldquo;Panama hosted the region&rsquo;s largest nesting Hawksbill assemblages until the latter part of the 20th Century&rdquo; it said.</p>
          <p>Japanese artisans used the tortoise shell to make beautiful crafts, like jewelry boxes, combs and ornaments. They were willing to pay impoverished fishermen money for the precious shells, but the beauty came at a cost.</p>
          <p>During these same years, the hunting of hawksbills dramatically reduced the nesting population in Chiriqui Beach. Peter Meylan, a professor at Eckerd College and researcher at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, said nesting populations
            declined by 98 percent.</p>
          <p>Meylan is among many scientists who believe there are only 20,000 nesting hawksbill females remaining in the sea. And the hunting of these turtles is only worsening. </p>

            A Conservationist Change

          <p>Today, the isles of Panama are critical for their restoration, as are men like Chencho.</p>
          <p>Chencho spends many days each year on Zapatilla Island, a small island where hawksbill turtles nest. He cleans them, feeds them and prevents others from stealing their eggs.</p>
          <p>But Chencho did not always help save the turtles like the one he kept in that jar.</p>
          <p>He used to kill them. </p>
          <p>&ldquo;I was in the hunting business for a long time when I was young,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You did it just to have money. You become a hunter just because people want to eat turtle. There used to be some people who would buy whatever amount
            of hawksbills you brought. But later the government intervened and told us: &lsquo;You have to stop, and this business has to come to a close.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Chencho was recruited to help protect the hawksbill turtles by Drs. Anne and Peter Meylan, an American couple who have dedicated their lives to research and conservation efforts. </p>
          <p>&ldquo;One day, I saw a few gringos walking closer my house and I was like, &lsquo;What are they looking for?&rsquo;&rdquo; Chencho recalls. &ldquo;They were looking for my house, asking for Chencho. Another man was with them and brought them
            to the house. They were looking for my help to work with nets and other stuff, but not to kill fishes.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>[Meylan&rsquo;s story of how they heard about Chencho]</p>
          <p>&ldquo;I thought to myself, &lsquo;I am minding my own business and now here come these people to bother me,&rsquo;&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But Mr. Meylan told me, &lsquo;No. You will have a job, but first you must stop hunting turtles for food.&rsquo;
            After that, my wife told me to take the chance, to see if things would turn out for the better. And since 1989, I&rsquo;ve seen the changes. A conservationist change.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>For more than 26 years, Chencho has been working alongside the Meylans to help in their efforts to restore the hawksbill population.</p>
          <p>[Quote from Meylan&rsquo;s]</p>
          <p>Efforts to repopulate the coral with hawksbills will help restore biodiversity in the reefs and improve the coral&rsquo;s health. But the conservation efforts haven&rsquo;t been easy. </p>
          <p>Poaching of nesting females is on the rise, predators like local cats and dogs, as well as the rise of tourism and development in Bocas del Toro are all threats, according to Meylan.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Scientists say that out of a thousand turtles, just one can survive. But I don&rsquo;t believe that,&rdquo; Chencho says. &ldquo;I think that number is too little.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Despite the turtles&rsquo; harrowing fate, Chencho remains optimistic for the turtles &mdash; perhaps because of his own change in heart. </p>
          <p>&ldquo;I've changed a lot. The first time I came (to Zapatilla) was just for money. lt is different now,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;A few years ago I became angry because of whatever nonsense, not now&hellip; Not anymore. I'm different now. I didn&rsquo;t
            like cats; now I love cats. If I can help a cat, I do. And it&rsquo;s the same with dogs.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>And it&rsquo;s the same with turtles.</p>
