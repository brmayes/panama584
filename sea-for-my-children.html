          <p>The Caribbean Sea is flat. Occasionally, a wave erupts and disturbs the peace, but on a placid, cloudy day, the sea doesn&rsquo;t change much.</p>
          <p>Under the sea, however, the quickest environmental change since the Jurassic Period 145 million years ago is challenging the coral reefs of Bocas del Toro, Panama, to adapt and survive, or to die altogether.</p>
          <p>The corals suffer from harmful conditions due to extreme rises in Caribbean Sea temperatures, Karl Castillo and Janina Seemann, two scientists researching the health of the corals, said on separate occasions. Castillo is a marine ecologist at UNC-Chapel Hill, and Seemann is a German marine ecologist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Bocas del Toro. Because the coral reefs struggle to survive, Bocas del Toro&rsquo;s marine ecosystem is rapidly deteriorating.</p>

            <figcaption>Dr. Karl Castillo snorkels in the Bocas del Toro Lagoon while extracting cores from coral skeletons in June 2015.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>Despite such harmful conditions, Castillo and his lab of marine ecologists could be on the brink of identifying corals that are strong enough to overcome the changing Caribbean ecosystem.</p>
          <p>Sarah Davies, a postdoctoral researcher in the Castillo Lab, is impressed by the resilience of the corals.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Some of the coral are pretty badass,&rdquo; she said referring to the Siderastrea siderea. This coral is commonly known as the massive starlet coral and is affectionately called Big Red by boat divers in Bocas del Toro. Over the past year, the Castillo Lab extracted samples of the coral from Bocas del Toro and flew them to their lab at UNC to examine <a href="/game.html" target="_blank">how they react to certain environmental changes</a>.</p>
          <p>The lab rigged up water tanks and light bulbs in a converted janitor&rsquo;s closet to mimic natural sea and sunlight conditions to study some of the samples. The researchers said a coral&rsquo;s ideal temperature is 28 degrees Celsius, and it will often bleach if that temperature moves up or down more than one or two degrees. </p>
          <p>But they found the massive starlet coral was able to survive in a 32-degree Celsius environment with all other conditions nearly identical to its natural state in the Caribbean Sea.</p>
          <p>Kathryn Cobleigh, the lab technician and a 2015 graduate of UNC, studied the coral for three years as an undergraduate researcher in the lab. She sees the potential in the corals adaptability. </p>
          <p>&ldquo;[These coral] might be the next powerhouses of the Caribbean,&rdquo; she said. Microevolution has favored the massive starlet coral and to many of the lab&rsquo;s researchers, it seems to be one of the coral species that will thrive in the warmer future.</p>

            Corals mean the world to an ecosystem
          </p>

          <p>Corals are animals similar to anemone: they move very little. They move only enough to pluck a small percentage of their food out of the water with their tentacles, forcing them to rely on a symbiotic relationship with algae, which live in the surface of their bodies, to obtain most of their energy.</p>
          <p>Algae are plants that gain energy through photosynthesis, which converts the carbon dioxide algae consume into the oxygen algae&rsquo;s host corals need to survive.</p>
          <p>Janina Seemann explained that as the sea&rsquo;s temperature rises, algae produce too many chemicals called oxidants that harm their host corals and prevent the algae from feeding themselves or their coral properly. This forces the coral to expel them from their bodies, leaving behind the coral&rsquo;s white, limestone skeleton.</p>

          <figure class="story-image">
            <img alt="Diseased reef" src="media/stories/reef/seaformychildren_stills_albacollins-2.jpg" />
            <figcaption>A diseased reef off the coast of Bocas del Toro is undergoing the process of bleaching, in which the algae that provides most of the coral’s nutrients begins to die, leaving only the coral’s outer white skeleton.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>This is called <a href="http://www.popsci.com/how-coral-bleaching-happens-video" target="_blank">coral bleaching</a>, and it&rsquo;s a sign the coral is nearing death.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;The corals have a certain buffer for stress,&rdquo; Seemann said. &ldquo;Just imagine you are already half-sick, and you get exposed to an influenza virus. You will get totally sick by that. That's the same with the corals. If they're already half-stressed, this bleaching will stress them out until they're dying.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Seemann said bleaching happens in the Caribbean about every five years now. Before the 1990s, it happened every 20 to 30 years. Considering the corals need about five years to recover from a bleaching event, the scope of the problem becomes more apparent.</p>
          <p>The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association <a href="http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2015/100815-noaa-declares-third-ever-global-coral-bleaching-event.html" target="_blank">declared</a> in October 2015 the third ever global bleaching event on record. Thus, it seems natural the Panamanian government would decide to erect land preservation sites across the Bocas del Toro region.</p>

          </figure>

          <p>In March, the Panamanian Ministry of the Environment held a press conference in Bocas del Toro to discuss government-regulated land preservation sites to be developed in the region soon. At the conference, Samuel Vald&eacute;s D&iacute;az, director of protected areas and wildlife for the ministry, presented his plan to accomplish just that with the recognition that the public needs to understand the government&rsquo;s reasons for land protection.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t understand the importance of protecting the land,&rdquo; he said. The ministry is working to establish no-diving zones in the sea and other areas to limit human disruption of the land.</p>

          <p>Some say the reason the sea&rsquo;s complex ecosystem is changing so drastically is partly due to the community of people surrounding it. Land conservation is avoided, misconceptions about corals are widespread and garbage pollution is common.</p>
          <p>Although people indigenous to the island have an ancestral attachment to caring for the land and sea around them, many of the indigenous, the islanders and the tourists don&rsquo;t understand the long-term changes underway in Bocas del Toro&rsquo;s coral ecosystem or how to do something to fix it.</p>
          <p>Walking along the Isla Colon coastline, the coastline on Bocas del Toro&rsquo;s main island, cubed fences, one to two feet high, are filled with the rocky skeletons of dead and dying coral. They are strategically placed to mitigate the harsh tides that wash onto shore.</p>
          <p>This began when the Caribbean&rsquo;s sea level began to rise around Bocas del Toro, and locals decided fences would be adequate for warding off physical damages the tide caused. The problem is the corals as they exist in the ocean serve the same purpose, and do a better job when they&rsquo;re able to live in their natural habit rather than die on shore, Seeman said.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;So that is the moment when you can do a little bit of environmental education.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Seemann and her colleague recently produced a film project about the accumulation of garbage pollution around their island in Bocas del Toro to better understand how locals perceive the environmental issues in their community.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that the people don&rsquo;t care &mdash; because you sometimes have the impression that they don&rsquo;t care &mdash; but they actually realize something is going in the wrong direction,&rdquo; Seemann said. &ldquo;[They realize] we will lose the tourism through that because if you have garbage everywhere, which is also in the oceans; if you&rsquo;re losing all the coral reefs; if you&rsquo;re losing all the fish, you will end up being on a garbage island without any attraction any more.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>To mitigate some of that misunderstanding, Seemann works to educate her community on the island in addition to her work with the Smithsonian Institution. Between 2011 and 2013, she visited three Bocas del Toro schools to teach students between ages of 7 and 19 years old the history of the coral reefs around their island and their responsibility to care for Bocas del Toro.</p>
          <p>For her 2013 project, students interviewed their grandparents about what life near the sea was like when they were younger: &ldquo;What did you eat?&rdquo; &ldquo;How was life?&rdquo; She wanted her students to understand the difference between Bocas del Toro&rsquo;s present-day environment and the environment two generations prior.</p>
          <p>The responses they received put the island&rsquo;s changes into perspective. The students recognized their families largely consisted of fisherman, that there would be no fish to eat without a healthy sea, that the sea can&rsquo;t be healthy without healthy corals to provide a home for much of the sea&rsquo;s life, that corals can&rsquo;t be healthy without a healthy marine ecosystem, and that the ecosystem can&rsquo;t be healthy without contribution from them.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;That actually helped the kids understand the change instead of just talking about it all the time,&rdquo; she said.</p>
          <p>A more recent visit to a school in Bocas del Toro proved that some students still learn the importance of recycling and environmental health. At the Colegio Rogelio Josu&eacute; Ibarra, a high school in Bocas del Toro, ninth-grade students make chains of recycled fabric to understand ways they can recycle waste and make art.</p>
          <p>But many didn&rsquo;t realize their willingness to preserve and protect the environment could either help or severely hurt something as specific as the the corals off the coast and change the nature of their island lifestyle.</p>
          <p>Although it may be difficult to sustain coral health education in schools, Seemann and her family partner, a native of Bocas del Toro, teach their own children, of 1 and 3 years old, to be mindful of the world around them.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;We educated them about cycles &mdash; how nothing disappears. Nature is part of you. You are a part of the nature,&rdquo; Seemann said.</p>
