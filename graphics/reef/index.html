      <p>
        On site in Bocas del Toro, Panama, Karl Castillo&apos;s research lab collects coral cores, samples of
        corals shaped like cylinders that the researchers transport back to their lab at the University of North
        Carolina at Chapel Hill. Each core is a timeline dating back years in a coral&apos;s life and health history.
        Layer by layer, the researchers measure the density of each coral&apos;s skeleton and how that changed over
        time, allowing them to determine whether the coral&apos;s environment
        was suitable for growth that year.

          <h4>Dissecting the Coral</h4>
          <p>
            Instructions: An isotope proxy is a sample of a coral layer marine ecologists use to determine temperature
            and other environmental factors that affect coral growth rates. Based on industry standard equations, researchers
            can determine the temperature, precipitation level, pollution level, and freshness or saltiness of the water
            around that coral for each rainy and dry season of each year of a coral&apos;s life. Explore the coral sample.
